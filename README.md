# StabilityMetrics

Calculates resistance, recovery time, recovery rate and variability at multiple spatial scales using MODIS version 6 EVI data.
These measures are calculated using EVI anomalies, which are generated in Multiscale_anomalies.R


Graphics to investigate these metrics are in StabilityXMetrics.R where X is the pixel resolution of investigation.
